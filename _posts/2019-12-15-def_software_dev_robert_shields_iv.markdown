Back in my younger years, all I wanted to do was just figure out how gadgets work. From evaluating a blank screen that only took commands on an IBM computer, learning the ends and outs of windows 95, using MS-DOS, and even using Limewire on dial-up to create my PowerPoint projects in 5th grade. It felt like me and computers spoke the same language. (This is before I knew binary code existed). I even remember creating weird those MySpace pages.

It was only until Fall 2018, that I began to question my level of comfort in my life.  I was always %.playing_it_safe. 

careers = [“Store manager”, “Photographers”, Personal_Trainer”, “Flight attendant”] 

Most would evaluate my path as lucrative and satisfying. "You have the opportunity to see the world!"  "You meet so many individuals!" "I bet the money is great"  Although I enjoy seeing places I never thought I'd see.  It wasn’t enough for me, as I searched for ways to challenge myself mentally. I never want to feel like I'm "just another number." So I read, built projects, and began breaking into Technology.  I begin to focus using a “Deep Work” technique and learn about the opportunities in tech, then coded day and night!  I had a good amount of momentum built up, from going through the lessons in FreeCodeCamp to blazing through Udemy courses. It was like I finally figured out what drove me to pursue my passion. The ability to help others, solve issues, and to create things that would help others live a better life!

Before my best friend died a while back she always told me to always be willing to #Learn things that will be beneficial to your life, #Apply it throughout your journey, then #Teach it to others.  During that time, I was a completely different person: Selfish, narcissist, and a man without ambition. Now fast-forward, I have so much love to give, and I’m here to measure my own success while serving others in the process

Technology is our future, and as an aspiring engineer, I’m in a unique position where I can work in various industries: From Healthcare, Sports, Finance, Entertainment, Media, and the list goes on!  Technology has a future of endless possibilities. So always stay ahead of the curve. 

dream.to_upcase() => DREAM

Being introduced to Career Karma, and talked to Ruben and Timur. I was skeptical initially, but it still felt right.  I knew that if my dream of becoming a software engineer wasn’t scary and exciting at the same time, then the dream wasn’t big enough.

// Flatiron //

When I received my acceptance letter into Flatiron, the feeling was exhilarating!  It finally felt right because I didn’t feel alone.  There are so many individuals that are in similar situations. The supply isn’t meeting the demand for engineers , but me and my Flatiron crew will break barriers.  They’ve invested their time/resources in me, so I will grind until I make my dreams a reality. We just want to do what we love while leveraging our skills as we become developers. I still struggle a bit in the networking department being an introvert, but I’ll always give my energy to those I vibe with. This journey will focus on networking, growth, balance, momentum, and achieving success, while striving to become greater than my circumstances.

I must admit that learning to { code } and retain information has been a challenge so far, and there are also various team barriers that make it difficult as well.  I often remind myself that nobody is better than anyone. I’ll continue to keep my momentum as I advance these skills into the new year.

[] Learn —fail-fast*

Don't let the fear of not understanding a lab assignment stop you from asking questions, building your moment, learning, and growing. Embrace those challenges throughout your own journey in life and break down everything in {Components}. Take an incremental approach.  Always have a thirst for knowledge, and know that you have 100% control over information.  Regardless of how much experience you obtain as a developer, remember to remain humble. Never reach a stage where you stop learning. There will always be new frameworks, new implementations, and new languages to learn.  

Today = Time.now

If i could go back and talk to my younger self, my advice to him would be to never give up and never ignore your passions. Use them to build a career that you love and can excel in. But timing is everything 

“And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.”  Steve Jobs
